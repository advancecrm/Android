                        Often the most important tool in medicine is the skilled examiner. Over the
                        course of gestation, babies develop a wide range of characteristics that can
                        be
                        measured through simple examination. As the baby develops muscle tone,
                        distinct
                        posture ensues, as well as measurable angles of resistance in key muscle
                        groups.

                        Physical characteristics are also key in determining gestational age. The
                        eyes transform
                        from being fused in very premature infants, to wide open in full-term
                        babies. The
                        skin and hair also give away important information in determining
                        gestational age,
                        as well as a host of other characteristics described in this site.

                        The New Ballard Score is a set of procedures developed by Dr. Jeanne L
                        Ballard,
                        MD to determine Gestational Age through neuromuscular and physical
                        assessment of
                        a newborn infant. This site is intended to provide detailed information on
                        gestational
                        age assessment, specifically focused on the New Ballard Score. In the
                        Monograph section each maneuver and examination
                        is described and illustrated in full detail. Use the score sheet
                        to record the results of each examination.
