                    the most valuable segment of the medical repertoire.

                    <h2> Overview</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Gestational age of a fetus or of a newborn can be assessed currently by three
                    different methods: the mother's menstrual history, prenatal ultrasonography and
                    the postnatal maturational examination.
                </p>
                <p>An accurate menstrual history, when obtainable, remains the best measure of
                    gestational age, but depends upon normal maternal physiology and an accurate and
                    reliable history.
                </p>
                <p>The prenatal ultrasound examination is one indirect method of assessing the
                    gestational age of the fetus. Based upon fetal body part measurements, it relies
                    upon normally timed and proportioned fetal growth rates. When performed early in
                    gestation, fetal ultrasound is a highly accurate method of assessing gestational
                    age. As the conceptus is exposed to a variety of intrauterine influences, fetal
                    growth may be affected in a variety of ways. (ref 1) Fetal ultrasound
                    measurements, affected by differential fetal growth, become increasingly subject
                    to the intrauterine environment as a gestation progresses. Late trimester
                    ultrasound measurements are therefore fraught with unavoidable inaccuracies as
                    indicators of fetal gestational age. (ref 2,3)
                </p>
                <p>The maturational examination, a postnatal, indirect method of assessing
                    gestational age, is based upon indicators of fetal neuromuscular and physical
                    maturation. (ref 4) As with fetal growth, fetal maturation may be influenced by
                    a variety of intrauterine experiences. Stressful fetal experiences may
                    accelerate pulmonary (ref 5) and neuromuscular (ref 6) rates of maturation while
                    slowing or not affecting physical maturation. A completely non-stressed fetus
                    may mature more slowly than the average fetus. The same events that accelerate
                    fetal maturation may adversely affect fetal growth. Conversely, those that
                    accelerate fetal growth may delay its maturation.
                </p>
                <p>Since certain fetal stresses may occur without the patient's of physician's
                    knowledge, the assessment of gestational age by maturational exam is is fraught
                    with uncertainties similar to, and probably greater than those surrounding fetal
                    ultrasound examination.
                </p>
                <p>Keeping those limitations in mind, one can more fully appreciate the usefulness
                    of both methods of fetal age assessment.
                </p>
                <p>Having said this, the neonatal maturational examination remains the most
                    universally accepted postnatal method of assessing gestational age.
                </p>
                <p>To perform the assessment, the most sophisticated of all technological
                    developments is necessary - the clinical observer.
                </p>
