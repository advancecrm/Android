                Summary of the New Ballard Score Monograph</h3>

            <p>
                The sum of
                all 12 criteria represents the neuromuscular and physical maturation of
                the fetus. When compared to the grid on the score sheet, the score
                denotes the infant's gestational age by maturational examination.</p>
            <p>The
                maturational assessment of gestational age is a clinical tool that may
                be influenced by certain biological factors. A working knowledge of the
                assessment tool includes a knowledge of the standardized method for
                performing the exam, and an awareness of those intrauterine factors that
                influence the neuromuscular and physical maturational rates of the
                fetus. This approach increases the accuracy and validity of the tool and
                facilitates the examiner's understanding and interpretation of the
                score.</p>
