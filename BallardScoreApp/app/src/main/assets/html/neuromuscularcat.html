                The complexity of fetal brain development cannot be overstated. Even when one
                considers
                its unencumbered development, a myriad of untoward events could occur by chance
                alone. It is understandable then that any deviation from the normal intrauterine
                environment could influence the delicate balance between growth and differentiation
                of neural tissue and hence the rate of functional maturation of the developing fetal
                brain. When performing tests of neuromuscular maturation, we are making an indirect
                assessment of brain maturity, which in turn gives us an indirect measure of
                gestational
                age.</p>

                Muscle tone may be defined as &quot;the slight constant tension of healthy muscles
                which contribute a slight resistance to passive displacement of a limb.&quot; (ref
                7)</p>

                The newborn's neuromuscular examination includes an assessment of both active and
                passive muscle tone. If all newborns were normal and healthy, both active and
                passive
                tone could be used routinely to assess neuromuscular maturation. Active muscle tone,
                (motility, activity, or efforts at righting oneself) is markedly affected by states
                of illness, recent maternal medications, acute perinatal compromise and level of
                alertness. Hence active muscle tone is not consistently useful in evaluating
                baseline
                neuromuscular maturity. Passive tone essentially is unscathed by those same factors
                that profoundly affect active tone. Hence passive tone is useful for evaluating
                maturational development of the neonatal brain, regardless of the infant's state
                of alertness or level of wellness.</p>

                Passive tone may be further subdivided into extensor and flexor tone. The human
                fetus, lying primarily with limbs extended in the very early phases of development,
                gradually assumes a progressively flexed attitude. This is true whether development
                occurs in utero or in the nursery, (ref 8) and thus reflects maturation of the
                central
                nervous system rather than extraneous compressive forces of the uterus. Passive
                flexor tone gradually overcomes passive extensor tone as maturation progresses.</p>

                Progression of neuromuscular tone development proceeds in a caudo-cephalad and
                centripetal
                direction; i.e., lower extremity passive flexor tone develops slightly ahead of
                upper extremity tone, and distal passive flexion precedes proximal passive flexion.
                (ref 8)</p>
            <p>
                There are three possible methods of assessing passive flexor tone in the neonate.
                The first is extensor stretch or <i>passive flexion</i>, which may better be
                described
                as flexibility, and is used to evaluate the degree to which a limb can be flexed
                passively at the joint by the examiner. This maneuver requires no tone or extensor
                resistance on the part of the infant. We may be looking at mobility, flexibility
                or resistance to extensor stretch rather than at passive flexor tone.

                The second method of assessing passive flexor tone is <i>resistance to passive
                extension</i>.
                These maneuvers require;
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    a) that the untested portion of the extremity be resting quietly on a supporting
                    surface;</p>
                <p>
                    b) that the examiner be very sensitive to the infant's slight tendency to resist
                    extension; and</p>
                <p>
                    c) that the examiner avoid placing pressure on flexors being tested, thereby
                    interfering
                    with their function.</p>
            </blockquote>
            The third method of testing passive flexor tone is measurement of <i>angles of
            recoil</i>
            to a previously flexed position. This maneuver requires that the examiner;
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    a) pre-set the extremity to a flexed position; and</p>
                <p>
                    b) avoid fatiguing the flexors by maintaining the extremity in the extended
                    position
                    for too long a period of time prior to releasing.</p>
