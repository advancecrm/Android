For this reason, we look at completed weeks of gestation, so that we do not make the mistake of artificially overestimating the infant's gestational age.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 14px; text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 51, 0); font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;\">Another way of arriving at the correct week would be to round DOWN and not up when using the grid to convert the numerical score to weeks of gestation.</p><p><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Dr. Ballard</span></p><div class=\"post\"><div class=\"content\"><p><span class=\"smallFooter\"><b>References :</b>             <br />Ballard JL, Khoury JC, Wedig K,              <i>et al</i>: New Ballard Score, expanded to include extremely premature<br />infants.              <i>J Pediatrics</i> 1991; 119:417-423.</span></p></div></div>\"},{\"Question\":\"The paper form doesn't allow for odd week results.  Why does the scoresheet only list the even weeks?\",\"Answer\":\"<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 0); font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; text-align: justify;\">For bedside clinical and research purposes, we do use odd weeks by extrapolating between the five point increments in the score. In all cases, we record only completed weeks of gestation.</span></p><p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 14px; text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 51, 0); font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;\">(As this is a clinical tool, trying to arrive at 1/2 weeks would be false accuracy.)</p><p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 14px; text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 51, 0); font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;\">The score lists only even weeks for the sake of simplicity and brevity.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 14px; text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 51, 0); font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;\">To my knowledge there has not been a need for a complete list of ratings. Clinicians have extrapolated intermediate values similarly to the example given earlier, arriving at odd numbered weeks.</p>\"},{\"Question\":\"Can the assessment be performed on extremely premature infants (pre-20 weeks gestation)? When should it be performed?\",\"Answer\":\"<p>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 0); font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; text-align: justify;\">The validity of the Ballard score was tested on newborn babies down to 20 weeks gestational age, verified by early ultrasound examination. In these very immature infants, the correlation coefficient, tested against verified menstrual history, was 0.75 if performed prior to 24 hours postnatal age. After that it fell, largely because of rapid attrition in this vulnerable population. In short, yes it can be done, preferably sometime during the first day of life.</span></p><p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 14px; text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 51, 0); font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;\">The neuromuscular portion is based upon passive and not active muscle tone. &nbsp;The score is actually designed for infants who are sick and even on ventilators, as long as they are not pharmacologically paralyzed.</p>\"},{\"Question\":\"Why does the score increase as the square window angle actually decreases?\",\"Answer\":\"<p>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 0); font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; text-align: justify;\">Although it seems counterintuitive, the square window which measures the angle to which the wrist can be flexed passively, does indeed DECREASE as maturation progresses.</span></p><p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 14px; text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 51, 0); font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;\">This is so because Passive Flexor tone increases progressively during fetal maturation. The entire neuromuscular portion of the assessment is based upon this fact. At term and post term, the infant has maximum passive Flexor tone and minimum passive Extensor tone.</p><p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 14px; text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 51, 0); font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;\">AFTER term and post term, this maximum PASSIVE FLEXOR TONE DIMINISHES over the first year of life until there is a balance between passive flexor and extensor tone.</p>\"},{\"Question\":\"When assessing a newborn with no arms or other deformities, how are the related sections scored?\",\"Answer\":\"<p>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 0); font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; text-align: justify;\">This is an important question, since the same principle can be applied to a child born frank &nbsp;breech, with genu recurvatum, or with cryptorchidism. In any and all situations where the criterion cannot be performed, it is crucial that the rest of the assessment be performed, and that a score similar to the others be assigned. If it is skipped or given a zero value, the gestational assessment will result in a falsely low score, and hence in a falsely low gestational age.</span></p>\"},{\"Question\":\"Do most hospitals that you are familiar with keep the Ballard Score on paper, or are they entering the information into the computerized patient record?\",\"Answer\":\"<p>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 0); font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; text-align: justify;\">Most of the hospitals I was familiar with before EMR's became the norm kept the gestational assessment form in the paper chart. More recently many hospitals are going over to electronic medical records, and that includes the Ballard Score. Either way is fine, &nbsp;as long as it remains a part of the baby's birth medical record.</span></p>\"},{\"Question\":\"Is there a curve or graph that correlates well with the Ballard Score?\",\"Answer\":\"<p>We used Dr. Lula Lubchenco's growth curves for both clinical care and  research activities. We did this because these were the most accessible  and most widely used, and had become standard practice. Her graphs also  come with weight-length or &quot;ponderal index&quot; percentile curves, which I  have found very useful in my research.</p><p>Dr. Lubchenco's data were  derived from babies born in Denver at mile high altitude. There was some  concern that these babies were therefor smaller, rendering the growth  curves lower, and resulting in a greater number of LGA babies if born at  sea level. However, the mean weight differences between the Denver  babies and those born at sea level were not found to be significant.</p><p>In short, I believe most people use the Luchencho charts  for sizing newborn infants as well as for determining whether or not  they are proportionately grown. They are regularly used in conjunction  with the Ballard Score.</p><p><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Dr. Ballard</span></p><div class=\"post\"><div class=\"content\"><p><span class=\"smallFooter\"><b>References :</b>             <br />Ballard JL, Khoury JC, Wedig K,              <i>et al</i>: New Ballard Score, expanded to include extremely premature<br />infants.              <i>J Pediatrics</i> 1991; 119:417-423.</span></p></div></div>\"},{\"Question\":\"Error\",\"Answer\":\"An error has occurred retrieving the rest of the FAQs.
